# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch 

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. :rocket:

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](./README.md)
* For this task, please write an amazing README.md


### [1. Header](./0-index.html)
* Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

### [2. "What we do..." section](./1-index.html)
* For this second task: create the “What we do…” section


### [3. "Our results" section](./2-index.html)
* For this third task: create the “Our results” section


### [4. Contact us](./3-index.html)
* A good landing page has always a contact form.


### [5. Footer](./4-index.html)
